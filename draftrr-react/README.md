## _'spellcheck on the next draft'_

Draftrr is a writing application that encourages finishing the first draft.

Minimal interface.

No formatting ability.

Two preferences, an email address and a timer slider between 1min and 3min.

The slider determines how long the text you are typing is available for edit. If you set the timer to 2 minutes, two minutes after you type a letter, it becomes grayed out and cannot be edited.

2000 characters after you type it, it disappears completely.

The email is assigned to someone other than you. Only they can ‘unlock’ your first draft.

Formatting and spell checking can be done in the rewrite, but you can’t get to the Final Draft until you finish the first.
